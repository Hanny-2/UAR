# UAR: Detecting AI-Generated Images Using Only Real Images

The rapid advancement of image generation technologies has led to highly realistic synthetic images, whose spread poses a threat to public trust and security. In real-world scenarios, where the generative model behind a fake image is unknown, an effective detector should be capable of identifying out-of-distribution generated images. Current methods typically focus on identifying common artifacts across different generative models. However, these methods often erase a substantial portion of image information, resulting in detection failures even when fakes are visually distinguishable. Our experiments show that autoregressive features are effective for detecting generated images, allowing us to eliminate the reliance on artifacts and preserve the image information. Building on this finding, we propose Universal Autoregressive Detection (UAR), which is trained exclusively on real images. We generate negative samples by reconstructing real images with a variational autoencoder (VAE), rather than using AI-generated images. UAR achieves an average accuracy of 94.18\% across 16 generative models, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SoTA) by 2.49\%. Additionally, UAR exhibits stable performance under various perturbations.
